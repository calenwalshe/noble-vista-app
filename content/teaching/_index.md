## Multivariate Statistics with R

Explore modern techniques for analyzing complex, high-dimensional data using R. This course emphasizes the intuition behind multivariate models and the practical skills needed to implement them on real-world datasets.

### What you'll learn
- Core concepts in multivariate probability, estimation, and inference
- Dimension reduction methods such as principal component analysis and factor models
- Supervised techniques including discriminant analysis and partial least squares
- How to diagnose model assumptions, interpret outputs, and communicate findings effectively

### Learning experience
Each week combines short lectures with live coding demonstrations in R, followed by hands-on labs that reinforce the statistical ideas. Students complete collaborative data investigations and a final project that applies the full workflow—from data preparation to visualization and reporting—on a dataset of their choice.

### Who should attend
The course is ideal for graduate students, analysts, and researchers who have a foundation in statistics and want to deepen their multivariate toolkit while strengthening their R programming practice.
