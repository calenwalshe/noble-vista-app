      - Steered ad-quality measurement using Hive analytics and large-N surveys; influenced >$1B revenue and roadmaps across ranking and creative systems.
      - Built ad-performance classifiers at Meta scale; improved AUC +3â€“5 pts and calibration error âˆ’20â€“30%, informing ranking and budget allocation decisions.
      - Designed causal measurement combining experiments and observational logs; delivered trustworthy lift readouts for launches across key ad surfaces.
      - Linked survey signals to on-platform behavior with Bayesian hierarchical models; reduced bias 15â€“25% and improved targeting validity across cohorts.
      - Authored reusable Hive pipelines and SQL UDFs; cut insight turnaround 30â€“40% and standardized metrics across Ads teams.
      - Led 50+ experiments annually; applied variance-reduction techniques to shrink required samples 20â€“30% while maintaining power and guardrails.
      - Partnered with PM/Eng as Staff-level bridge; raised decision velocity 25â€“35% via playbooks, dashboards, and preregistered analysis templates.
      - Prototyped ad-tech POCs (creative quality, budget pacing); projected ROI +8â€“12%, enabling investment decisions and phased rollouts.
      - Instituted experiment quality gatingâ€”power analyses, holdout checks, pre-mortemsâ€”reducing false launches 20â€“30% and boosting trust in causal readouts.
      - Defined UX quality metrics (fatigue, diversity, trust) balancing revenue and experience; enabled ranking changes with consistent 2â€“4% engagement lift.

Calen Walshe is a lead quantitative researcher at Meta, where he drives insights and optimizes large-scale advertising systems on the Meta Ads team. He leverages his academic background in statistical modeling, machine learning, and visual cognition to bring rigorous, data-driven solutions to complex problems.

Previously, his research focused on computational models of eye movements, visual attention, and learning, combining psychophysics, modeling, and naturalistic tasks to uncover how humans allocate gaze, control fixation durations, and process information during visual search and scene viewing. His work advanced dual-process models of gaze control and revealed mechanisms underlying visual sensitivity and adaptive behavior.
